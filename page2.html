  Ma girl
  i am really sorry again for whatever i did
  Breaking up with you whenever I want to, coming back to you when I want to, but princesa, you're not just a background character in my story, you're the main character.. you're the one for me my love, my faults are countless.. but one such fault of making you cry is the one hurting me the most, I'd never want to leave you in the position of crying and making you feel I'm not there for you anymore... 

  I am going to take this piece by piece, slow and calmly, but I'm determined, I have conviction.

  I only want you..
